Git internal:

A Commit.
Tracks files:
1. Paths 
2. Peermission
3. Contents

specifically not to directories.
Head -> commit(ab124) -> commit2(ab301){both commit state the difference between file}
Changing multiple time we get the commit history.
chain of the commit to diff that happen.
git automatically start branching when you go back to any previous commit and start changing the file.
git does it internally.
eg.

commit(ab123) <- commit(asd234)
this will creat new fork repo to the older version.
